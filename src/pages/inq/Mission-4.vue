  Mission 4: The Haunted Ruin
This is the tile where you use the holy water.
Henricus will give you a Special Flask (vial of holy water). Go to Liberty Bay and use the vial on an old house, here. Use the vial on the most north-west corner!, just like the image shows:
After using the vial one Pirate Ghost will appear and the door will close. Kill it if you want to and after around 10 Seconds the door will open.

Get back to Thais and report your mission to Henricus.
