 Mission 6: The Demon Ungreez
Ask to Henricus for a mission. He wants you to kill a demon called Ungreez. Head to Edron Hero Cave and go down a few levels, here.

The demon takes around 5â€“15 minutes to respawn, depending on how many that are online on the server, and each person must kill him once (by dealing the most damage). Ungreez is like a regular Demon.

After killing Ungreez, Henricus will give you the first addon.

Note: After finishing this mission (report the mission with Henricus) you cannot access this room again.
