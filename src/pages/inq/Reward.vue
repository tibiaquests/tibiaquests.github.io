Rewards
Report back to Henricus, the quest will appear "completed" in your quest log and you will earn the High Inquisitor achievement.

Now ask to Henricus for a outfit. He will give you the 2nd addon of the Demon Hunter Outfits, and you will earn the Demonbane achievement.

Now you can enter to the Reward Room. But remember: you may only choose one out of the 9 prizes. Just after you take your item, you earn the Master of the Nexus achievement.

Also, you will be able to buy the Blessing of the Inquisition (all five blessings at once, 10% more expensive) with Henricus.
