 The Dark Path (Ushuriel)
Go up the stairs to the west of the Demon Forge retreat. You will be in a path with many Hellfire Fighters and Massive Fire Elementals. Follow the path east and go up the stairs. You must now walk north through a great hall, filled with Stone Golems, Gargoyles, Behemoths and Juggernauts. Be careful when luring monsters here, groups of up to 4 Juggernauts can be found.

Tip: juggernauts do not walk over energy fields.

At the end of the hall is a Teleport which leads to Ushuriel and many eyes of the Seven. Wear a stealth ring (or cast Invisible) and enter. Ushuriel is not particularly strong for a competent group, but the eyes are deadly in masses - do not lose invisibility or you may die quickly.

Once Ushuriel is dead, enter the portal to go to the next area, the Crystal Caves.

Note: do not enter the teleport before Ushuriel is dead! You will be sent to the demon forge retreat and have to walk through the Dark Path again if you do.
Note: once Ushuriel is dead, you must not wait more than 2 minutes before entering the portal or you will be sent to the retreat instead of the next area (the Crystal Caves).
