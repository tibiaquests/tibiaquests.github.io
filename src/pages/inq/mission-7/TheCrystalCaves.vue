 The Crystal Caves: Zugurosh
You will be greeted by several Crystal Spiders, Spectres and Ice Golems, and later Hands of Cursed Fate. Head as far east as you can. When you reach a wall, go south and then west to eventually find stairs.

Go up the stairs to the The Mirror Maze of Madness. Here you will find many Phantasms (many of them will be summons), Giant Spiders and Nightmares.

You are now at the teleport room
Go through this teleport to an undersea cave passage. Here you will find many Quara Predators, Quara Pinchers, Quara Hydromancers and Massive Water Elementals.

Walk far east to find the teleport to Zugurosh.

Now you must defeat Zugurosh. He is immune or strong to almost every element except physical. His next biggest weakness is energy. In addition to Zugurosh there are pillars across the room's border which will reduce your shielding to around 1-11. The battle against Zugurosh is a test of endurance. He will drain all of your supplies if you are unprepared.

A good strategy is to have a few paladins run Zugurosh over Fire Fields, while shooting at him. This way, his invisibility will be cancelled every time he walks, and paladins are quite effective hitters. Another strategy is to summon Fire Elementals to speed up killing, however keep in mind this battle will be quite consuming.

Once he is dead, go through the teleport to be teleported to the Blood Halls. This area is extremely dangerous, even upon entering! It may be a good idea to enter the teleport back to the retreat when you enter the blood halls, so your team can reorganize and, if necessary, resupply after Zugurosh.
