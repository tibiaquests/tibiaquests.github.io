The Shadow Nexus
Do NOT use the teleport to return to the retreat. There is no other way back to the Shadow Nexus other than to walk all the way back to Hellgorak's room.

The final room consists mostly of Furys, Juggernauts, Demons, Undead Dragons and Hellhounds. Demons are constantly spawned by Magic Pillars, so it is a waste of supplies to kill them as the tower spawns them endlessly, as soon as one dies another one is summoned. Each Magic Pillar spawns 1 Demon. (Note: Placing parcels or field runes around the Magic Pillars will not keep them from summoning Demons) There are a total of 5 of the Magic Pillars. Their locations are shown in the picture below they have blue circles around them, the Shadow Nexus is the two small red dots twords the center of the room.

Whilst blockers are holding these creatures, players should approach the magicwall in the centre of the chamber, a magicwall [see picture below].

Players should:

Use the vial on the magicwall to electrify it.
Use the vial when the wall changes from electric to a burned out Fire Field ontop.
The magic wall returns to the energy stage, and after 20 seconds goes back to a burned out Fire Field ontop.
Use the vial again on the magicwall, and again it returns to the electric stage.
The magic wall returns to the energy stage, and after 20 seconds goes back to a burned out Fire Field ontop.
Use the vial a 3rd time on the magicwall.
The magicwall becomes fully ignited with a full Fire Field ontop.
From here, the player must use the vial one more time to complete their mission.
The full Fire Field lasts for around 10 seconds, and if any player can reach the full Fire Field and use their vial on it, they have instantly completed the mission. A maximum of 4-5 people can complete the mission per full Fire Field before it resets to the original position, and the aforementioned steps must be repeated - unless you are on an optional-PvP server, where everyone can stand on the same spot and complete the mission at the same time.

It is recommended to have a high level druid cast Mass Healing repeatedly at this point.
