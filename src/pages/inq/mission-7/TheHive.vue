 The Hive: Hellgorak
You will instantly be greeted by multiple Nightmares, Bonebeasts, Sons of Verminor and Juggernauts. Head north towards many ramps, where you will see more of the same monsters, Ancient Scarabs and Hellhounds. Continue to head north where there will be more ramps with the same creatures and Giant Spiders. Again, head north and slightly east to the final set of ramps. Go up and kill the Juggernauts, Sons of Verminor, Nightmares and Demons. Enter the teleport to face Hellgorak.

He is very strong against all damage types, so have everyone convince the Dreadbeasts summoned in the room. These will damage him and allow you to defeat him. This is the only way to defeat Hellgorak. Enter the teleport to enter the Shadow Nexus.
