 The Vats: Latrivan & Golgordan
The Vats contains many Sons of Verminor, Plaguesmiths, Blightwalkers and Defilers.

Note: A Dwarven Ring is recommended for the Blightwalkers.

After entering the Vats, proceed east/north-east. It is recommended to hug the south wall to find less monsters. To the far east you will find a teleport to The Battlefields.
