    First go to the Ghostlands and go down a hole here<br />
    Go south and go down a hole. Here are some Skeletons, Skeleton Warriors, Ghouls and some Poison Spiders.<br />
    <q-img src="banshee/banshee2.png" width="20%" />
    <br />
    <br />

    Go south-east and go the hole down.<br />
    <q-img src="banshee/banshee3.png" width="20%" />
    <br />
    <br />
    Go to the Magic Walls east from the rope spot. <br />
    <q-img src="banshee/mw.png" width="30%" />
    <br />
    <b>ATTENTION</b>: Everyone that pass the magicwalls should stack on the first sqm after the mwall,<br />
    otherwise the magic wall will close.<br />
    <b>ATTENTION</b>: Do not go through the teleport! <br />
    Go through the hole, the teleporter is for going back if the Magic Walls have closed.<br />
    <br />
    To open the Magic Walls you need to use 2 switches. <br />
    <q-img src="banshee/switchMW.png" width="30%" /><br />
    There is 1 switch west of here and 1 switch east of here (see the red arrows).<br />
    The east switch is guarded by a Giant Spider. <br />
    <b>East Switch</b><br/>
    <q-img src="banshee/eastSwitch1.png" width="30%" />
    <q-img src="banshee/eastSwitch2.png" width="30%" />
    <br />
    <b>West Switch</b><br />
    <q-img src="banshee/westSwitch1.png" width="30%" />
    <q-img src="banshee/westSwitch2.png" width="30%" />
    <q-img src="banshee/westSwitch3.png" width="30%" />
    <br />
    To get to the west switch you have to go through many scorpions, 3 demon skeletons <br />
    and some ghouls and then in the switch room there are 2 Bonelords, 1 Demon Skeleton, 2-3 Stalkers and Ghouls.<br />
    <br />
    Now go up the stairs (B).<br />
    <br />
    TIP: Start with the east switch if you go alone then the west switch, <br />
    remember to use haste from the first switch when it has been pulled <br />
    because the walls close when anyone steps on the hidden buttons. <br />
    These buttons are in the path after the magic walls (first and second square meters to the left), <br />
    so if you have a team, it is easier if one person goes to each switch, <br />
    uses them and 5 people from the team goes trough where the magic walls used to be, <br />
    and then open again if you have more people on your team. <br />
    Once the switch pullers come back, make sure no one comes back <br />
    or they will close the magic walls and you will have to open them again.<br />
