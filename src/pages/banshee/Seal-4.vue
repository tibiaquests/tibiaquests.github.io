    <span class="text-h6">Fourth Seal: The Seal of Sacrifice</span>
    <br />
    Go back down and go to the stairs north from here (C in previous image). <br />
    Go up into the room where you'll find 5 ghosts, 5 stalkers and 2 demon skeletons.  <br />
    Go down the other stairs, and just follow the way to the next stairs.  <br />
    The next room will be filled with poison fields, Ghosts and Demon Skeletons. <br />
    Going up the stairs, you'll be in point A in the next image.  <br />
    Walk north through this room.  <br />
    In the north corner of this room lies the forth seal.  <br />
    This is where you need the vial of blood. <br />
    Use the vial and spill the blood between the two stones (on the tile that looks like the depot tiles),  <br />
    you should see a small animation on the stone tables around the tile.  <br />
    Go through the flame and back through the teleporter.  <br />
