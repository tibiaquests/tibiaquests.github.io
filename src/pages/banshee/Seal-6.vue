    <br />
    Go from A to B as shown in Image 1, you will go to C shown in Image 2 then go north (you will face 2 Giant Spiders), <br />
    after that use pick on the place marked in the map and you will go down to Image 3. <br />
    On Image just go from A to B there is nothing to fight there. <br />
    Go up in B in the Image 3, but be careful there will be a lot of demon skeleton and other creatures <br />
    to fight up there in Image 4.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    In Image 4 go from A to B and use pick to get access to the sixth seal room. <br />
    Note: you will pass by a rope spot in the middle of image 4, this leads to the catacombs of the Isle Of The Kings, <br />
    the fastest way out of the quest from here.<br />
    <br />
    Once you have found the place to use pick go down and face more demon skeletons, <br />
    place the pearls where the picture shows and pass through the teleport.<br />
    <br />
    You can use either left teleport or right teleport, it doesn't matter. <br />
    After you have walked through a teleport, head north through a couple of poison fields <br />
    and walk through the teleport which you find at the end of the way. <br />
    In the room where you now arrive, walk through the teleport which you see there. <br />
    You will be taken back to the spot behind the pearls teleport - just walk in the teleports there <br />
    to be returned to the spot with the sacrifice tables. <br />
