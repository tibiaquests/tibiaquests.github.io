    <span class="text-h6">Last Seal: The Kiss of the Banshee Queen</span>
    <br />
    Go to The Queen Of The Banshee (it's close to seal #4), <br />
    she is surrounded by 4 banshees, 2 mummies, 2 ghosts and 3 stalkers <br />
    so be careful killing them (UE'er would be nice).<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    After clearing all of the banshees around the Queen talk to her and say:<br />
    <br />

    Hi<br />
    Seventh Seal<br />
    Yes<br />
    Yes<br />
    Yes<br />
    Yes<br />
    Yes<br />
    Yes<br />
    Kiss<br />
    Yes<br />
    <br />
    You will then be teleported to a small room with a "your dead body". <br />
    Go up the stairs and you'll be in the surface of Ghostlands again.<br />
    Note: Keep in mind that if you are not level 60 you will NOT be able to finish this seal, <br />
    the queen will say that you are not experienced enough.<br />
