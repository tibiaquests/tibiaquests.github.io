    Continue through the stairs in the 2 blood vial room located by the (B in previous image) and go from A to B from there. <br />
    Then go again from A to B.<br />

    This part gets a little tricky. For every person in your party, you will face 2 warlocks. <br />
    In the tight corridor to the south, you will see 2 special tiles, like the ones you see in front of the depot box. <br />
    After stepping on either one, you will spawn the 2 warlocks. <br />
    It doesn't matter if you step on them again after this. <br />
    One will spawn north of the tiles, in the corridor, while another will spawn south in the room below, <br />
    typically the NE corner.<br />
    <br />
    It is ideal for the main blocker to go down first and keep the warlock occupied while the team kills the other. <br />
    Having killed the other, the blocker should run up again, allowing the team to kill the second warlock. <br />
    The person going through the tile should simply step on it and go back up the corridor unless they are the blocker.<br />
    <br />
    An alternative strategy if you solo this part and can't kill 2 warlocks, is just ignore them and pull the switches <br />
    while constantly healing. Be cautious they don't throw fire fields on the switches (you could bring destroy field runes).<br />
    Don't rush it, just calmly walk and pull the switches while healing very often.<br />
    <br />
    After the whole team has stepped on a tile, each person must pull the switches in the order as shown below <br />
    and proceed through the fire. Fifth seal done.<br />
