    <br/>
    Go south, rope yourself up (B in the previous image) and then continue south. <br />
    At the end, go west, up the ramp and down into a round chamber (C in 1st seal image).  <br />
    In this room are 3 Ghosts, 3 Stalkers and 4 Demon Skeletons. Go down the stairs. <br />
     <br />
    Walk as far to the south-east from (A in the following image) and you will come to the second seal.  <br />
    You will have to go through: Ghosts, Stalkers, Demon Skeleton and many Scorpions.  <br />
    You need to organize the switches so the match the second image.  <br />
    Then go through the flame and back through teleporter.  <br />
    Only one person needs to do this for the others to go through.  <br />
