    <br />
    Backtrack to the stairs at the north-west part this floor (B in previous image).<br />
    Go down to be faced by ghosts.<br />
    You will need to go to the stairs (B in the next image) from where you came down (A in the next image). <br />
    On the way you will encounter 10 banshees. <br />
    Keep in mind that you'll never face more than 3 at a time in this area, and usually they are lure-able. <br />
    On the way, you will find a quest door which conceals a box with the Spectral Dress, <br />
    which is needed for the Explorer Society Quest.<br />

    Go north-west to the stairs (from A to B in the next image). <br />
    Careful as you'll encounter another banshee. <br />
    Go up and walk on the tiles as shown on the second image. <br />
    Go through the flame and back through the teleporter. <br />
