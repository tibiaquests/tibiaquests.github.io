    After clearing the room, you can open the body on the top of the room to get some junk and a book,<br />
    the book is brother Fugios diary which has an important role in The White Raven Monastery Quest, but it is optional.<br />
    You will see a stone surrounded by poison fields.<br />
    Walk over the poison fields and a switch will appear beneath it.<br />
    Use the switch to reveal some stairs.<br />

    <br />
    Go down the stairs and go through the teleporter (A).<br />
    Going through the teleporter on the other side (D) will take you back to the magic walls.<br />
    Go south in this long hall and use your pick in the middle of the hall as depicted by the red arrows.<br />
    If you simply keep going south, you will be teleported back.<br />
    Go down the pick hole to find the first seal room.<br />
