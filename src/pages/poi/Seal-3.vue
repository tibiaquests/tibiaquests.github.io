The Throne of Decay (Ashfalor)
When you go through the teleport, you'll find yourself in a graveyard. In this room you will meet Liches, Demons, undead Dragons and possibly Dracola guarding the throne. Walk south, but be careful not to make the Undead Dragons use their wave attacks on the entire team. Walk on to the throne and step on it twice to absorb some of Ashfalors spirit, then return to the teleporter.
