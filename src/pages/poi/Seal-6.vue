The Throne of Damnation (Tafariel)
In this throneroom you will meet Banshees, Dark Torturers, Demons, Lost Souls and possibly Mr. Punish. Follow the path slowly to avoid too many creatures at once until you reach the throne, step on it twice to absorb some of Tafariels spirit, then return to the teleporter.
