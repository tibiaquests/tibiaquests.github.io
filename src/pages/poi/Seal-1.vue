    The Throne of Despair (Pumin)
Enter the north-eastern portal to find a long hallway with 4 dead bureaucrat NPCs. To enter Pumin's domain you must gain permission from the bureaucrats. Use the following dialog. Each bureaucrat is numbered from 1 (furthest south) to 4 (furthest north).

GET STUCK? THERE IS A TIP: All NPCs here are dull, and there is a little chance they will simply ignore you, because they didn't understand you. So in some cases you have to talk with them multiple times. To be sure NPC correctly heard you, check Dialogs Transcription at the bottom of page. If NPC answer matches Dialog Transcription then you can move to next NPC.

A Dead Bureaucrat 1: Hi / Pumin / your_name / your_vocation / Pumin
A Dead Bureaucrat 4: Hi / Pumin / your_name / your_vocation / 356
A Dead Bureaucrat 3: Hi / Pumin / your_name / your_vocation / 145
A Dead Bureaucrat 1: Hi / 411 / no
A Dead Bureaucrat 2: Hi / 287
A Dead Bureaucrat 1: Hi / 411 / Yes
A Dead Bureaucrat 3: Hi / 145
A Dead Bureaucrat 4: Hi / 356
A Dead Bureaucrat 1: Hi / 356
When the team is all ready, go in the teleport north to enter Pumin's domain. There will be Spectres, Betrayed Wraiths, Demons, Hands of Cursed Fate and (rarely) The Handmaiden. Fight your way through the throneroom but be mindful of the invisible walls. Step on the throne to absorb some of Pumin's spirit. It is recommended you do this twice to be sure.

Tip: if you find yourself having problems with the invisible walls, you can 'use' a distant tile and the server will automatically find the quickest route to it (assuming there are no obstacles in the way).
Tip: the pillars support an invisible floor above there. You can levitate up near the start of the throneroom and walk freely to the throne, but that doesn't mean you can "skip" the throneroom - you will still have to kill most of the monsters.
Note: The NPC area of Pumin's domain is the only safe area until the reward room.
