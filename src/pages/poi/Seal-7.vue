The Throne of Destruction (Apocalypse)
Enter the north teleport in the main room to appear in a wrecked ship. There will be Destroyers, Furies, Demons, Juggernauts and (rarely) Massacre. This throneroom is relatively small. Be careful as the Juggernauts come in groups. Step on the throne to absorb some of Apocalypse's spirit. It is recommended you do this twice to be sure.
