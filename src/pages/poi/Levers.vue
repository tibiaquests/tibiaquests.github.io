The Levers
The "PoI levers" area is located here and the 3 floors below. There are Spectres, Diabolic Imps, Defilers, Destroyers, Hellfire Fighters, Plaguesmiths and Lost Souls. There are 15 switches that must be pulled in the correct order to make the final switch work for a small period of time. This switch makes the 2 rocks near the entrance vanish and you gain access to a ladder.

You must pull 15 levers in the given order.
Note: The rocks reappear after 15 minutes.
Note: There's an emergency exit after the rocks if your team needs to leave after you pass the rocks. Be warned, this teleport does not take you out of PoI: it takes you to the other side of the rocks. However, you can also take the shortcut by walking south of the 2 Blightwalkers, which is a safer exit.

Up the ladder you will find 2 Blightwalkers, 15 levers and a book with the following riddle:

look at the 4 and ignore the 2
  end the 7 with 5 in mind
  value of 6 is 9
  explain the second of 4
  run past the 7
  substract 10
  use the northeast first
  see the colors change
  errors are red
  look what changes
  expect no mercy
  six times 10
  stupidity is red.

All the levers are USELESS. Just read the first letter of all the lines.

The team must now split in two. Leave a team behind that can handle Defilers, Hellfire Fighters, Betrayed Wraiths and Blightwalkers. The other team must go ahead to the Pits of Inferno Spa.

To access the spa, have a person stand 1 sqm south of the rock in the center of the room (with the skeleton corpse on it). A player must go north and pull both levers, to access the hole to the spa.

In the spa you will fight Diabolic Imps, Nightmares, Defilers, Destroyers, Hellfire Fighters, Phantasms, Dark Torturers, Plaguesmiths, Blightwalkers and Fire Devils. Make your way to the east part of the spa (here) and search for a floor tile. When a person stands on this tile, a ladder appears in the room where you left the other part of the team. Have the team go up and clear the room, and then go back and stand on the tile where the ladder appeared, so they can rope you up.

The stairs will appear when a player steps on the switch in the Spa.
The NPC Demonguard you will meet does not have a purpose. If you talk to him he will set you on fire.

Proceed by roping up again. The rope hole is 1 sqm north of the hole to go back down. You are now at the maze.
