Blood* [in any container]
You need blood to pass Goshnar's grave to access the Pits of Inferno. On Optional PvP players can stack and go down together, but on Hardcore PvP or non-dove Open PvP each player must bring their own.
Oil* [in any container]
You need oil to lubricate the Lever to open a bridge and access the Pits of Inferno Dragon Lair. One person can bring oil but it is recommended others bring some in case the bridge closes.
Key 3700
You need this to open the final reward room. At least one person in the team must have the key!
Destroy Field Rune*
Fields spawn on top of the hole to enter the Pits of Inferno. Also, there are many levers you will need to pull and many Hellfire Fighters which can cover them with fire.
One player of each Vocation.
Each vocation is needed to open a vocation-specific flame after the Pits of Inferno Dragon Lair. They do not need to join for the rest of the quest.
