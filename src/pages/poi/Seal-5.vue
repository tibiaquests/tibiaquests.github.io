The Throne of Inferno (Infernatil)
In this throneroom you will meet Hellfire Fighters, Hellhounds, Demons and possibly The Imperor. often in large groups at the same time. Walk slowly here and try to lure them one at a time. Near the throne will be a switch hidden beneath fire, use destroy field to uncover it so you can get to the throne, step on it twice to absorb some of Infernatils spirit, then return to the teleporter.
