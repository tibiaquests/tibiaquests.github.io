    Getting the Key 3700 and the Holy Tible
Pits of Inferno Quest Items.jpg
Get Key 3700 from southern Venore, and Holy Tible near the Knightwatch Tower.
To get Key 3700 take the south exit of Venore and walk south-west. By a small body water you will find a hole. Dig it and drop down to 2 Bonelords and 3 Ghouls. Open the chest to the north for Key 3700. You can find the hole here.

Obtained

To get the Holy Tible, you must walk to a small mountain very close to the Knightwatch Tower, south of the Plains of Havoc temple. Inside the mountain will be a chest containing this book, which has the graphics of the old T-Book. You can find the chest here. Note that you need either the Levitate spell or 3 Parcels to go up the little mountain.

Obtained

Necromant's House and Pits of Inferno Dragon Lair
Foreword: it is advised to bring many vials of blood in case you make a mistake and/or for other team members.

Pits of Inferno Quest Entrance.jpg
Enter Goshnar's tomb by using blood on the gravestone while standing south of it.
Pass the Shrine of Wonders by stepping on the carvings with the Holy Tible in your backpack.
Enter the Pits of Inferno (level 30 expertise door to the east).
Oil and pull the lever, and walk across the bridge.
If there is lava in your path, destroy the stone with a Pick.
Go to the Plains of Havoc graveyard and dig a Loose Stone Pile (there are many leading to the same narrow cave). In the east part of the cave there's a 3x4 room. In this room, use a Pick on the north-west corner of the room (here). Go down the hole and 1 sqm south of Goshnar's gravestone (directly west of where you landed). Use the Blood on the gravestone and every player on that tile will be taken to the catacombs. To the south you'll find many Demon Skeletons and Ghosts but this is not part of the quest. Go north and step on the inscribed floor tile before a Magic Wall and it will take you to the other side (assuming you have a Holy Tible). Free Account players cannot pass this wall.

Optionally you can now go down the north hole to a small garden and the Well of Life, drinking from this will restore your health once and give you the achievement Fountain of Life.

To the east is a sign that says "To the Pits of Inferno". Go down this hole and south where you'll find a bridge which may be complete or broken. If it is open you can cross, if it is closed you must use Oil on the lever south of the bridge on the west side.

Note: if the bridge collapses while you are across, the only way back is by going through the PoI dragon lair! You can throw oil to the other side if your team needs it.

You will now see either a river of lava or a cool molten floor. If there's lava, you need to use a Pick on the stone near it to cool it. Once the lava is cooled you can cross to 3 holes, all leading to the PoI dragon lair. Prepare for many Dragon Lords and go down the northern hole (closest to the quest area). To the east is a rope hole that will lead you to a room filled with purple fires.
