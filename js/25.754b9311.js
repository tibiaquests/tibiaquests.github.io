At least two very high level knights (190+) must try to go up the stairs and to corners with the monsters. Immediately, sio'ers must go up and sio the blockers or just let a mage (150+) stair jump with Any Ue (Recommended Rage of the skies or Eternal Winter).\n\nGo west, then south and you will find another stairs. You can use the same tatic of previous stairs here. Go east, then north and you will find a teleport.\n\nGoing through this teleport and you will be in a room with several Juggernauts, Hellfire Fighters, Plaguesmiths, Furies and Destroyers. Shooters must Magic Wall to make a barrier or many monsters will come at same time.\n\nAfter kill all monsters, go to the southeast corner of the room and you will find the teleport to Madareth's Ward.
