Go down the ladder and then head north. In this room there will be a teleporter into a room that looks the same, but has 2 Magicthrowers, some Hellfire Fighters and a switch on the floor that will set the whole room on fire. When you enter this second room a stone will be blocking the people behind you, you will have to flick the switch several times to make everyone pass. Once everyone is inside, continue north.\n\nYou will enter a room with some Phantasms, Betrayed Wraiths, Plaguesmiths, Blightwalkers and a Hand of Cursed Fate. This is the main room with 7 teleporters into the Ruthless Seven thronerooms and 7 electrical barriers to the north to deny you access to the reward room until you have the corresponding spirit of the Ruthless Seven.\n\nThe rest of the quest is a simple concept: clear the thronerooms and step on the thrones to absorb some of their spirit.\n\nNote: Remember to check the Quest Log after you have stepped on a throne to be sure you have completed that throneroom. It is also recommended that you step on the throne twice. If you are pushed back and see the text 'Begone!' you know you have done that throne.\nNote: It is is no longer possible to leave one player behind to block the spawn in the main room, so during a quest service a part of the host team must be left in the room to keep it clear, or when hunting, you must keep in mind that after returning to the main room you will be faced again with the creatures.\nImportant note: Once you have entered (not completed) at least one of the thronerooms, you will be granted access to a teleport shortcut to the Main Hub located one floor above to ground in the Necromant House behind a sealed door. You now will have now a fast access to hunt here and to boss checks.\nSidenote, you have to absorb at least one of the thrones' essences to be able to access to the Demon Forge in the last mission of The Inquisition Quest.\n\n  ")])},s=[],a=o("2877"),r=o("9989"),h=o("eebe"),i=o.n(h),l={},u=Object(a["a"])(l,n,s,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=u.exports;i()(u,"components",{QPage:r["a"]})}}]);
