You will need a large team with plenty of firepower and support. Level 150+ for all team members is strongly recommended. Remember to bring your vial of holy water, you will need it to destroy the Shadow Nexus.\n\nYour mission is to go to the Demon Forge and slay seven of The Ruthless Seven Minions. The Demon Forge is located in the Edron Hero Cave, through a portal in the Temple of Xayepocax. Upon entry you will immediately be ambushed by Hellfire Fighters, Fire Devils and Fire Elementals. Kill them and go south to the Retreat.\n\nNote: In order to access the Demon Forge you must have absorbed the spirit of at least one of The Ruthless Seven in The Pits of Inferno Quest. Check your quest log to see if you have. You must have also reported your earlier mission to kill Ungreez.\n\nThe Retreat is a hub which allows easy access to the sections of the Demon Forge. By each teleport you will notice signs on the walls, indicating where it leads. You will not have access to any of the portals right now, they are unlocked through the quest. You must instead walk the Dark Path.\n\nFrom here until you reach The Shadow Nexus, your mission is quite simply: kill your way to a boss room, kill the boss, exit via the teleporter within 2 minutes to unlock the next area. Repeat this until you reach the Shadow Nexus (after killing Hellgorak).\n\nKeep in mind the following for the rest of the quest:\n\nIf you step in a teleporter inside a boss room before the boss is dead or after 2 minutes of slaying the boss, you will return to The Retreat. You will not gain access to the next area if you do not enter it. The same is true if you die in the boss room: you will have to repeat the process even if your team kills the boss after you die. For this reason, you must also kill each demon boss in a specific order (except Latrivan and Golgordan which are fought together).\nIf you enter the teleport at the start of a section of the Demon Forge, it will take you back to the Retreat. You can leave to resupply and return later without losing any progress. This only applies if the area is accessible from the hub, otherwise it will take you to the previous subsection (i.e. The Battlefields will take you back to the Vats).\nWhen entering boss rooms, you may be close to the teleport out. Keep calm! If you accidentally jump into the teleport at the sight of a boss, you will have to repeat that section. When entering the boss room, just don't move until you are aware of your surroundings.\nWhen you are granted access to a teleport in the hub, it is permanent. If you die, you can always return.\nYou do not have to do this quest in one sitting. You can always resume from where you left off by going into the teleport of the first unfinished section.\nThe quest log will tell you nothing. Do not search it to confirm your status. The only way to check where you are up to is by entering the portals from last to first: the first one that works is the one you need to do. In the case of The Hive you can check your quest log if you are done with this mission.\n ")])},n=[],i=o("2877"),a=o("9989"),r=o("eebe"),l=o.n(r),h={},u=Object(i["a"])(h,s,n,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=u.exports;l()(u,"components",{QPage:a["a"]})}}]);
