There are Spectres, Diabolic Imps, Defilers, Destroyers, Hellfire Fighters, Plaguesmiths and Lost Souls. There are 15 switches that must be pulled in the correct order to make the final switch work for a small period of time. This switch makes the 2 rocks near the entrance vanish and you gain access to a ladder.\n\nPits of Inferno Quest 2.png\nYou must pull 15 levers in the given order.\nNote: The rocks reappear after 15 minutes.\nNote: There\'s an emergency exit after the rocks if your team needs to leave after you pass the rocks. Be warned, this teleport does not take you out of PoI: it takes you to the other side of the rocks. However, you can also take the shortcut by walking south of the 2 Blightwalkers, which is a safer exit.\n\nUp the ladder you will find 2 Blightwalkers, 15 levers and a book with the following riddle:\n\nlook at the 4 and ignore the 2\n  end the 7 with 5 in mind\n  value of 6 is 9\n  explain the second of 4\n  run past the 7\n  substract 10\n  use the northeast first\n  see the colors change\n  errors are red\n  look what changes\n  expect no mercy\n  six times 10\n  stupidity is red.\n\nAll the levers are USELESS. Just read the first letter of all the lines.\n\nThe team must now split in two. Leave a team behind that can handle Defilers, Hellfire Fighters, Betrayed Wraiths and Blightwalkers. The other team must go ahead to the Pits of Inferno Spa.\n\nTo access the spa, have a person stand 1 sqm south of the rock in the center of the room (with the skeleton corpse on it). A player must go north and pull both levers, to access the hole to the spa.\n\nIn the spa you will fight Diabolic Imps, Nightmares, Defilers, Destroyers, Hellfire Fighters, Phantasms, Dark Torturers, Plaguesmiths, Blightwalkers and Fire Devils. Make your way to the east part of the spa (here) and search for a floor tile. When a person stands on this tile, a ladder appears in the room where you left the other part of the team. Have the team go up and clear the room, and then go back and stand on the tile where the ladder appeared, so they can rope you up.\n\nPoI Levers Stair.png\nThe stairs will appear when a player steps on the switch in the Spa.\nThe NPC Demonguard you will meet does not have a purpose. If you talk to him he will set you on fire.\n\nProceed by roping up again. The rope hole is 1 sqm north of the hole to go back down. You are now at the maze.\n  ')])},r=[],s=a("2877"),n=a("9989"),h=a("eebe"),l=a.n(h),i={},p=Object(s["a"])(i,o,r,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=p.exports;l()(p,"components",{QPage:n["a"]})}}]);
