The maze has only 3 floors, if you are on the 3rd floor then any rope holes will take you out of the maze and into Pits of Inferno Dragon Lair, with no way to return to the maze.\nNote: Do not under any circumstances use a Lever or Magic Forcefield as they may take you to the wrong places. When pulled, the levers become nonfunctional, so your teammates can't use the same lever to help you.\nNote: If some of your team is sent back to the start of the maze, they can be roped up to the second last room of the maze (from the first room). There is no rope counterpart on the bottom, so someone must have reached the end to do this.\nNote: If you need/want to view the maze on TibiaWiki's mapper, here is where you start.\n\nIn Bazir's domain you must traverse a maze with many traps. You will face Phantasms, Nightmares, Demons and \"Demon\" Goblins.\n\nYou can follow the images below (recommended) or the directions following them.\n\nImage route\nFollow the green lines. They will end on a hole or a rope spot - this indicates to go up/down at that tile.\nWhen the image line ends on a tile other than a rope spot or hole, you are at the end. Follow the spoiler below.\nPits of Inferno Quest Bazir Maze Floor 1\nBottom floor, including the start.\nPits of Inferno Quest Bazir Maze Floor 2\nMiddle floor.\nPits of Inferno Quest Bazir Maze Floor 3\nTop floor, including the end.\n\nDirections\nFor ease of use, with each numbered step you will be in a different room. On step 5 you would have gone up or down 4 holes.\n(2-3 Phantasms, 2 Nightmares): from the portal, go west across the fire fields, south a few steps and then east. Half way east you will find either a rope hole, fire field or trash. Rope up.\n(2 Nightmares): rope up the hole on the north-east.\n(2 Demons, 3-4? Demons (Goblins)): Go south and west around the cave walls, then north. Drop down the hole.\n(2? Demons (Goblins)): Go south, drop down the hole (not up).\n(3-4? Phantasms, 3-5? Nightmares, Countess Sorrow (rare)): Go south all the way, a little west and then south again. Follow the path all the way east and then north. Go up the hole.\n(nothing): Go up the hole on the north side of the room.\n(2 Nightmares): go west and then north-east. Go down the hole (east side of the cave).\n(nothing?): go west and north a few squares. Drop down the hole.\n(2 Demons (Goblins)?): go west and rope up the hole.\n(nothing): go north around the hole and drop down the hole on the north side of the room.\n(nothing): go north, east a few squares, then north again. Rope up the rope hole (it may be hidden under a fire field).\n(2? Nightmares, 2-3? Demons (Goblins)): go north, east, and then south. Rope up the hole on the east side of the cave, probably hidden below fire fields.\n(3 Nightmares): you are now in the final room. Follow the spoiler below.\nAfter the maze\nNow that you are at the final room, pull the lever on the south-east side of the room. The lever may be covered by an Orc corpse. A teleport will appear at the south-western hole. Enter the teleport to exit the maze.\n\nYou are now in a room with some Platinum Coins. The coins are on a higher, unreachable floor. Walk to them and you will be teleported to another room.\nGo north and find a Magic Forcefield. The forcefield is on a higher floor, so levitate up or find the hidden ladder on the north-west side of the room you are in. Enter the portal.\nYou are in a room with void all around it. Move toward the treasure chest at either the south or north side of the room. Before you can reach them, you will be teleported to the next room.\nYou are now in a similarly structured room. Go to the western wall of the room and use the blue tapestry to move it. When moved, a mirror will be uncovered. Use the mirror to appear in the throneroom.\nGo to the north side in the middle. Step on his throne to absorb his spirit, and then again to appear at the previous room.\nYou are now done. To exit to the main room (be careful if the room is not clear), step on the carpet with the north-west knight statue.\n  ")])},r=[],a=t("2877"),h=t("9989"),s=t("eebe"),i=t.n(s),l={},u=Object(a["a"])(l,n,r,!1,null,null,null);o["default"]=u.exports;i()(u,"components",{QPage:h["a"]})}}]);
