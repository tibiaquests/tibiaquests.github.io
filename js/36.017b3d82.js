Watch your step! The maze contains tiles which will teleport you all over the maze, including to the start! None of the tiles will take you outside of the maze, but some do take you 1 sqm from the hole back to the Demonguard, so don't be hasty. Once your entire team is at the end of the maze, use a Pick on the tile in the middle.\n\nThe maze is built of 10 distinct zones. At least 9 of these you must visit on the way, and each of them are only accessed via a teleport tile. Teleport 1 takes you to zone 2, teleport 2 takes you to zone 3, etc.. Ultimately, there is only one path that you can take although some tiles can send you to a previous zone. The following image shows the most efficient route to take. Teleport tiles are labelled in green. Yellow asterisks indicate they will take you back to the start of the maze. The red lines indicate the source and destination of the teleport tiles you are required to take, and a dead end line indicates a rope hole which has only one destination. When you rope the hole on line 'U', proceed to the northernmost hole to continue to the next area of the maze (purple dotted line).\n\nPits of Inferno Maze Path Optimized.png\nTiles may teleport you, even to the start of the maze. This map shows one correct route to take.\nClick here for a more detailed image of the maze.\nLegend\n Green letters: teleportation tiles.\n Red dashed lines: teleport destinations.\n Yellow lines: one correct route to take (dead end means you must rope).\n Yellow asterisks (*): teleports to the start of the maze (in case you make a mistake - watch your step).\nThere are a few Hellfire Fighters and Magicthrowers which you must endure here. Have at least one player go to the east path and find the lever at the end (they may need Destroy Field Runes). Pull the lever to remove the rocks and have the team pass through. If the rocks return, the lever needs to be pulled again.\n\nTip: once the Hellfire Fighters have been killed, a mage can summon Demon Skeletons to absorb the Magicthrowers' attacks. To force the Magicthrowers to retarget to the DS, the team must go back up.\nNote: your team should wait at the ladder when they go up! If they move, the rocks will return and the lever must be pulled again.\nYou are now at a short one-way path which leads to the PoI point of no return. Keep walking until you fall down a tile, and then rope up again. You cannot go back now. You will see two holes: the north will bring you to the PoH slime cave with no way back in, and the south will lead you to the depths of PoI, where the Ruthless Seven makes its move.\n\nGo down the south hole and search the skeleton to receive the first installment of your reward: a Pirate Backpack with: a Ceremonial Ankh, a Death Ring, a Life Ring, 3 Orichalcum Pearls, 5 White Pearls, 2 Soul Orbs, 11 Platinum Coins, 2 Sudden Death Runes with 1 charge each, 3 Ultimate Healing Runes, Blank Rune and a Great Mana Potion.\n\nObtained\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n11\n\n3\n\n2\n\nNow make your choice. Head back with this loot, or go for the bigger prize and pass the level 80 door. Note that you cannot return via the exit, you must repeat all steps in the quest after the PoI levers (you may take the shortcut to skip to the PoI spa).\n  ")])},n=[],h=o("2877"),i=o("9989"),l=o("eebe"),s=o.n(l),r={},u=Object(h["a"])(r,a,n,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=u.exports;s()(u,"components",{QPage:i["a"]})}}]);
