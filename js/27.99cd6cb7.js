You will be in a path with many Hellfire Fighters and Massive Fire Elementals. Follow the path east and go up the stairs. You must now walk north through a great hall, filled with Stone Golems, Gargoyles, Behemoths and Juggernauts. Be careful when luring monsters here, groups of up to 4 Juggernauts can be found.\n\nTip: juggernauts do not walk over energy fields.\n\nAt the end of the hall is a Teleport which leads to Ushuriel and many eyes of the Seven. Wear a stealth ring (or cast Invisible) and enter. Ushuriel is not particularly strong for a competent group, but the eyes are deadly in masses - do not lose invisibility or you may die quickly.\n\nOnce Ushuriel is dead, enter the portal to go to the next area, the Crystal Caves.\n\nNote: do not enter the teleport before Ushuriel is dead! You will be sent to the demon forge retreat and have to walk through the Dark Path again if you do.\nNote: once Ushuriel is dead, you must not wait more than 2 minutes before entering the portal or you will be sent to the retreat instead of the next area (the Crystal Caves).\n")])},o=[],r=n("2877"),s=n("9989"),l=n("eebe"),i=n.n(l),h={},u=Object(r["a"])(h,a,o,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=u.exports;i()(u,"components",{QPage:s["a"]})}}]);
